# Selector is needed to be added to let itself know that to which pods to be point to.

# Lables are basically a name given to a pod or deployment.
# Lables are important in PODs because they are given a unique name, so to identify the same pods on different replica, lables are used.
# Labels are optional in deployments but a good practice

# Deployments will know its PODS by using Matchlables in the specification. It should match the label of Pods.

# Template in deployments are PODS
# POD container where only one container is recommended to be ran
